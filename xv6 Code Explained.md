Hello, world.

In this document, weâ€™ll attempt to explain the actual code of our beloved xv6.  
Not all of it, but some of the interesting parts.

God have mercy on us.

---

###`1217 main(void)`

The entry point of the kernel.  
Sets up kernel stuff and starts running the first process.

**1219**: set up first bunch of pages, for kernel to work with (minimal, because old harware has little memory)

**1220**: set up all kernel pages

**1223**: set up segment tables and per-CPU data

**1238**: set up the rest of the pages for general use (because until now we had just minimal, because other CPUs might not handle high addresses)

**1239**: set up the First Process

**1241**: run the scheduler (and the First Process)

---

###`2764 struct run`

Represents a memory page.  
A `run` points to the next available page/`run` (which is actually the *previous* page, because the first available is the last in the memory).

---

###`2768 struct kmem`

Points to the head of a list of free (that is, available) pages of memory.

---

###`2780 kinit1(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.  
Also does some locking thing (I'll elaborate once we actually learn this stuff).  
Used only when kernel starts up.

Called by [`main`](#1217-mainvoid).

---

###`2788 kinit2(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.  
Also does some locking thing (I'll elaborate once we actually learn this stuff).  
Used only when kernel starts up.

Called by [`main`](#1217-mainvoid).

---

###`2801 freerange(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.

**2804**: use PGROUNDUP  because `kinit1` in called to start where the kernel finished (which is not likely to end *exactly* at a page end).

Called by:

* [`kinit1`](#2780-kinit1void-vstart-void-vend)

* [`kinit2`](#2788-kinit2void-vstart-void-vend)

**1760**: make `%CR3` point to returned address

Called by [`main`](#1217-mainvoid).

---

###`1728 kmap[]`

Contains data of how kernel pages should look.  
Used by `setupkvm` for mapping.

**Column 0**: Virtual addresses  
**Column 1**: Physical addresses start  
**Column 2**: Physical addresses end  
**Column 3**: Pages permissions

**Note**: The `data` variable (used in lines 1730-1731 is where the kernel's data start (*data* is plural, by the way).  
We do not know during compliation where this will be.

---

###`1737 setupkvm(void)`

**Returns** page table address if successful, 0 if not.

and returns the **virtual** address of the the *index* i1.  
**Returns** address if successful, 0 if not.

If there is no mapping, then:  
if `alloc`=1, mapping is created (and address is returned);  
if `alloc`=0, return 0

Some constants and macros used here:  
PDX - zeroes offset bits

###`1616 seginit(void)`

Sets segmentation table so that it doesn't get in the way, for each CPU.

**2476**: set up process's kernel stack, and switch to its page table

**2477**: mark process as running

**2478**: save current registers (including where to continue on scheduler) and load process's registers, handing the stage over to the process

**2483**: set per-CPU variable `proc` back to 0

**2485**: release process table, allowing other CPUs to grab processes (just in case 

Called by `mpmain`.

**2582**: release process table

**2583**: lock `lk` once again

---

###`1555 pushcli(void)`

Saves state of `%eflags` register's `IF` bit (that is, the current state of "listen to interrupts?" bit),  
increments the "how many times did we choose to ignore interrupts" counter,  
and clears the "listen to interrups" bit.

**1561-1562**: save initial state of bit in `interna` var (FL_IF is the location of our bit)

Called by:

* [`acquire`](#1474-acquirestuct-spinlock-lk)

* [`switchuvm`](#1773-switchuvmstruct-proc-p)

---

###`1566 popcli(void)`

Decrements the "how many times did we choose to ignore interrupts" counter,  
and if it reaches 0 then sets the "listen to interrups" bit to whatever it was before the very first `pushcli` was ever called.
