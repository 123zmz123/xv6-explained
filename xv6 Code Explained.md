Hello, world.

In this document, weâ€™ll attempt to explain the actual code of our beloved xv6.  
Not all of it, but some of the interesting parts.

God have mercy on us.

---

###`1217 main(void)`

The entry point of the kernel.  
Sets up kernel stuff and starts running the first process.

---

###`2780 kinit1(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.

---

###`2788 kinit2(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.

---

###`2801 freerange(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.

2804: use PGROUNDUP  because `kinit1` in called to start where the kernel finished (which is hardly likely to end exactly at a page end).

---

###`2815 kfree (char *v)`

Frees the page that `v` points at.  
Fills it with 1s, and adds it to the beginning of `kmem`.

2819-2820: address validity checks  
2823: fill page with 1s, to help in case of bugs  
2827-2829: insert our page into the beginning of `kmem`

---

###`2838 kalloc(void)`

Removes a page from `kmem`, and returns its address.

2844-2846: remove first free page from `kmem`  
2849: return address

---

###`1757 kvmalloc(void)`

Builds new page table and makes CR3 point to it.

1759: make table and get its address  
1760: make CR3 point to returned address
