Hello, world.

In this document, weâ€™ll attempt to explain the actual code of our beloved xv6.  
Not all of it, but some of the interesting parts.

God have mercy on us.

---

###`1217 main(void)`

The entry point of the kernel.  
Sets up kernel stuff and starts running the first process.

**1219**: set up first bunch of pages, for kernel to work with (minimal, because old harware has little memory)

**1220**: set up all kernel pages

**1223**: set up segment tables and per-CPU data

**1238**: set up the rest of the pages for general use (because until now we had just minimal, because other CPUs might not handle high addresses)

**1239**: set up the First Process

**1241**: run the scheduler (and the First Process)

---

###`2764 struct run`

Represents a memory page.  
A `run` points to the next available page/`run` (which is actually the *previous* page, because the first available is the last in the memory).

---

###`2768 struct kmem`

Points to the head of a list of free (that is, available) pages of memory.

---

###`2780 kinit1(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.  
Also does some locking thing (I'll elaborate once we actually learn this stuff).  
Used only when kernel starts up.

Called by [`main`](#1217-mainvoid).

---

###`2788 kinit2(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.  
Also does some locking thing (I'll elaborate once we actually learn this stuff).  
Used only when kernel starts up.

Called by [`main`](#1217-mainvoid).

---

###`2801 freerange(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.

**2804**: use PGROUNDUP  because `kinit1` in called to start where the kernel finished (which is not likely to end *exactly* at a page end).

Used by `setupkvm` for mapping.

**Column 0**: Virtual addresses  
**Column 1**: Physical addresses start  
**Column 2**: Physical addresses end  
**Column 3**: Pages permissions

**Note**: The `data` variable (used in lines 1730-1731 is where the kernel's data start (*data* is plural, by the way).

**Returns** address if successful, 0 if not.

If there is no mapping, then:  
if `alloc`=1, mapping is created (and address is returned);

increments the "how many times did we choose to ignore interrupts" counter,

**3474-3480**: while required number of ticks didn't pass, loop

- **3479**: wait for event #`&ticks` (we don't really need the lock in this case, but usually in `sleep` call we need to lock because other cases we `sleep` for disc or something else where we don't want two process's to grab the resource simultaneously)
