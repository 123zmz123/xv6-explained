# xv6-explained

This project serves as an explanation for xv6.

Note that the documents in the repository are updated during my xv6 course, so it is advisable to come back here once in a while to see if there's anything new.

- [Explanations.md](https://github.com/YehudaShapira/xv6-explained/blob/master/Explanations.md): General explanations of various stuff xv6 does, focusing on *why* rather than *how*.
- [xv6 Code Explained.md](https://github.com/YehudaShapira/xv6-explained/blob/master/xv6%20Code%20Explained.md): Actual documentation of the code
